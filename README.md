# MacroExpander
A standalone tool for the Rust Programming Language - Visualises macro expansion traces

For now, you will need to have a local copy of RustFmt and syntex on your computer. Change the paths in the Cargo.toml (and the Cargo.toml of Rustfmt) as appropriate to your setup. Minor code modifications (primarily visibility changes) also need to be made to rustfmt - this are covered in changelog.txt.
